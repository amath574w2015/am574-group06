Matlab code to generate the images of the Hugoniot loci and the integral curves.

The subfolder "export_fig_code" contains various functions downloaded from the internet which allow us to output figures in a nice format. Information of these functions can be found here: https://github.com/altmany/export_fig/blob/master/README.md

The subfolder "Images" contains the all the images generated by the Matlab code. These images are then used in the Latex document for our paper.
