Matlab code to generate the images of the Hugoniot loci and the integral curves.

The subfolder "export_fig_code" contains various functions downloaded from the internet which allow us to output figures in a nice format. Information of these functions can be found here: https://github.com/altmany/export_fig/blob/master/README.md

The subfolder "Images" contains the all the images generated by the Matlab code. These images are then used in the Latex document for our paper. 

The three functions UPlot, MPlot, and YPlot plot the figures in each plane: U, M, and Y, respectively. They each expect to be told which model to plot (currently only AR implemented). UPlot and MPlot expect to be told whether or not to check validity (using a boolean called "validity").

The two functions AwRascle_LociAndCurves and AW_CurvesAndLambdaContours call the plotting functions, and use export_fig_code to export the figures. AwRascle_LociAndCurves uses validity = false, AW_CurvesAndLambdaContours uses validity = true. Running both of these functions will generate all of the figures currently used in our paper.
